# Project Title

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and convey what your repo is for.

Using [Steam Store Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games) and [Most Played Games of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisaljanjua0555/most-played-games-of-all-time/code) datasets which scrap data from Steam, we will be showing the most played games of ????. In this project, you will see clear connections of the most played games with their ratings and with other popular games over the year. 

## Overview

Expand on those introductory sentences with a brief but informative description of your project's purpose and goals. This section should help visitors decide whether they should dig deeper into your repo/project.

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure

Use this section to explain the structure of your repo. This should help visitors quickly figure out where they should look to find certain elements. Further, you can use this space to highlight and briefly explain important/key files in the repo.

Code: Contains code files for data wrangling and data visualization
Data: Contains the datasets for Steam Store Games and Most Played Games of All Time
