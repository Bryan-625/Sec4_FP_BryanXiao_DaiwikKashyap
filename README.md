# Project Title

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and convey what your repo is for.

Using [Steam Store Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games) and [Most Played Games of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisaljanjua0555/most-played-games-of-all-time/code) datasets which scrapped data from Steam using Steam's API, we will be showing similarities in the most played games. In this project, you will see clear connections of the most played games with their ratings and the genres that they encompass. 

## Overview

The project focused on two research questions:
1. What genres are the most popular?
2. Does a higher player reception translate to a more popular game?

This project was designed to find the similarities in the most played video games on Steam. The analysis wants to see how the genre of a game and higher player reception affects the popularity of a game. We defined popularity by using the all time peak player count for a game.

## Repo Structure

Code: Contains code files for data wrangling and data visualization
Data: Contains the datasets for Steam Store Games and Most Played Games of All Time
ReadMe: Contains all the information about the project including the goal of the project, results, conclusion, and other statistical insights.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

We are using two datasets in this project.
Primary dataset: [Steam Store Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games)
This dataset has a combined data of 27,000 games that were taken from Steam. It has information like game name, release date, developer name, publisher name, platform, genre, game category, and age requirement.

Secondary dataset: [Most Played Games of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisaljanjua0555/most-played-games-of-all-time/code)
This dataset has a combined data of 5,000 games which are from Steam. It has information on the number of players that played games and then sorts that information into various columns like current most played games, and most played games of all time.
